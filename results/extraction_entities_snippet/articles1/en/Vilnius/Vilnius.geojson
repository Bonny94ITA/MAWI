La Pinacoteca raccoglie tele di pittori armeni (tra i quali quelli della famiglie di Naghash e Ayvazovski); è presente anche un'importantissima biblioteca formata da manoscritti armeni (antichi e preziosi), andando a formare una delle più grandi collezioni del mondo; tra le opere antiche e moderne la biblioteca della Mechitaristenkirche conta più di 170 000 libri, inoltre conserva giornali e periodici armeni.
