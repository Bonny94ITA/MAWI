171,Streets following the Public Land Survey System section lines later became arterial streets in outlying sections.
172,"As new additions to the city were platted, city ordinance required them to be laid out with eight streets to the mile in one direction and sixteen in the other direction, about one street per 200 meters in one direction and one street per 100 meters in the other direction."
173,The grid's regularity provided an efficient means of developing new real estate property.
174,"A scattering of diagonal streets, many of them originally Native American trails, also cross the city (Elston, Milwaukee, Ogden, Lincoln, etc.)."
175,"Many additional diagonal streets were recommended in the Plan of Chicago, but only the extension of Ogden Avenue was ever constructed."
