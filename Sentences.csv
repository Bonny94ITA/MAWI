489,"Between Sendlinger Tor and Maximiliansplatz, on the edge of the central Altstadt-Lehel district, there is also the so-called Feierbanane (party banana), a roughly banana-shaped unofficial party zone spanning 1.3 km (0.8 mi) along Sonnenstraße, characterized by a high concentration of clubs, bars and restaurants, which became the center of Munich's nightlife in the mid-2000s."
491,"In the 1960s and 1970s, Schwabing was considered a center of nightlife in Germany, with internationally known clubs such as Big Apple, PN hit-house, Domicile, Hot Club, Piper Club, Tiffany, Germany's first large-scale discotheque Blow Up and the underwater nightclub Yellow Submarine, and Munich has been called ""New York's big disco sister"" in this context."
492,"Bars in the Schwabing district of this era include, among many others, Schwabinger 7 and Schwabinger Podium."
493,"Since the 1980s, however, Schwabing has lost much of its nightlife activity due to gentrification and the resulting high rents, and the formerly wild artists' and students' quarter developed into one of the city's most coveted and expensive residential districts, attracting affluent citizens with little interest in partying."
494,"Since the 1960s, the Rosa Viertel (pink quarter) developed in the Glockenbachviertel and around Gärtnerplatz, which in the 1980s made Munich ""one of the four gayest metropolises in the world"" along with San Francisco, New York City and Amsterdam."
495,"In particular, the area around Müllerstraße and Hans-Sachs-Straße was characterized by numerous gay bars and nightclubs."
496,"One of them was the travesty nightclub Old Mrs. Henderson, where Freddie Mercury, who lived in Munich from 1979 to 1985, filmed the music video for the song Living on My Own at his 39th birthday party."
497,Transsexual icon Romy Haag had a club in the city centre for many years.[citation needed]
498,"Since the mid-1990s, the Kunstpark Ost and its successor Kultfabrik, a former industrial complex that was converted to a large party area near München Ostbahnhof in Berg am Laim, hosted more than 30 clubs and was especially popular among younger people from the metropolitan area surrounding Munich and tourists."
499,The Kultfabrik was closed at the end of the year 2015 to convert the area into a residential and office area.
500,"Apart from the Kultfarbik and the smaller Optimolwerke, there is a wide variety of establishments in the urban parts of nearby Haidhausen."
501,"Before the Kunstpark Ost, there had already been an accumulation of internationally known nightclubs in the remains of the abandoned former Munich-Riem Airport."
502,Munich nightlife tends to change dramatically and quickly.
503,"Establishments open and close every year, and due to gentrification and the overheated housing market many survive only a few years, while others last longer."
504,"Beyond the already mentioned venues of the 1960s and 1970s, nightclubs with international recognition in recent history included Tanzlokal Größenwahn, Atomic Cafe and the techno clubs Babalu Club, Ultraschall, , , , Die Registratur and Bob Beaman."
505,"From 1995 to 2001, Munich was also home to the Union Move, one of the largest technoparades in Germany."

512,"Munich has become a spiritual centre already since the times of Emperor Louis IV when philosophers like Michael of Cesena, Marsilius of Padua and William of Ockham were protected at the emperor's court."
513,"The Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU) and the Technische Universität München (TUM), were two of the first three German universities to be awarded the title elite university by a selection committee composed of academics and members of the Ministries of Education and Research of the Federation and the German states (Länder)."
514,"Only the two Munich universities and the Technical University of Karlsruhe (now part of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology) have held this honour, and the implied greater chances of attracting research funds, since the first evaluation round in 2006."

622,It outranks Frankfurt though as home of insurance companies such as Allianz (insurance) and Munich Re (re-insurance).
623,"Munich is the largest publishing city in Europe and home to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, one of Germany's biggest daily newspapers."

634,"Since the enactment of EU legislation concerning the concentration of particulate in the air, environmental groups such as Greenpeace have staged large protest rallies to urge the city council and the State government to take a harder stance on pollution."
635,"Due to the high standard of living in and the thriving economy of the city and the region, there was an influx of people and Munich's population surpassed 1.5 million by June 2015, an increase of more than 20% in 10 years.[citation needed]"
636,"Munich has an extensive public transport system consisting of an underground metro, trams, buses and high-speed rail."
637,"In 2015, the transport modal share in Munich was 38 percent public transport, 25 percent car, 23 percent walking, and 15 percent bicycle."
638,Its public transport system delivered 566 million passenger trips that year.
639,"Munich is the hub of a well-developed regional transportation system, including the second-largest airport in Germany and the Berlin–Munich high-speed railway, which connects Munich to the German capital city with a journey time of about 4 hours."

642,"For its urban population of 2.6 million people, Munich and its closest suburbs have a comprehensive network of public transport incorporating the Munich U-Bahn (underground railway), the Munich S-Bahn (suburban trains), trams and buses."
643,The system is supervised by the Munich Transport and Tariff Association (Münchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund GmbH).
644,"The Munich tramway is the oldest existing public transportation system in the city, which has been in operation since 1876."
645,Munich also has an extensive network of bus lines.
646,The extensive network of subway and tram lines assists and complement pedestrian movement in the city centre.
647,"The 700m-long Kaufinger Straße, which starts near the Main train station, forms a pedestrian east–west spine that traverses almost the entire centre."
648,"Similarly, Weinstraße leads off northwards to the Hofgarten."
649,These major spines and many smaller streets cover an extensive area of the centre that can be enjoyed on foot and bike.
650,"The transformation of the historic area into a pedestrian priority zone enables and invites walking and biking by making these active modes of transport comfortable, safe and enjoyable."
651,"These attributes result from applying the principle of ""filtered permeability"", which selectively restricts the number of roads that run through the centre."
652,"While certain streets are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths, which permeate the entire centre."
653,"In addition, these paths go through public squares and open spaces increasing the enjoyment of the trip (see image)."
654,The logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts – the fused grid.
655,The average amount of time people spend commuting to and from work with public transit in Munich on a weekday is 56 min.
656,"11% of public transit users, spend more than two hours travelling each day."

660,Cycling has a strong presence in the city and is recognised as a good alternative to motorised transport.
661,The growing number of bicycle lanes are widely used throughout the year.
662,"Cycle paths can be found alongside the majority of sidewalks and streets, although the newer and/or renovated ones are much easier to tell apart from pavements than older ones."
663,"The cycle paths usually involve a longer route than by the road, as they are diverted around objects, and the presence of pedestrians can make them quite slow."
664,A modern bike hire system is available within the area bounded by the Mittlerer Ring.
666,"München Hauptbahnhof is the main railway station located in the city centre and is one of three long-distance stations in Munich, the others being München Ost (to the east) and München-Pasing (to the west)."
667,All stations are connected to the public transport system and serve as transportation hubs.
669,"München Hauptbahnhof serves about 450,000 passengers a day, which puts it on par with other large stations in Germany, such as Hamburg Hauptbahnhof and Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof."
670,It and München Ost are two of the 21 stations in Germany classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 1 station.
671,The mainline station is a terminal station with 32 platforms.
672,The subterranean S-Bahn with 2 platforms and U-Bahn stations with 6 platforms are through stations.
673,ICE highspeed trains stop at Munich-Pasing and Munich-Hauptbahnhof only.

675,Since 28 May 2006 Munich has been connected to Nuremberg via Ingolstadt by the 300 km/h (186 mph) Nuremberg–Munich high-speed railway line.
676,"In 2017, the Berlin–Munich high-speed railway opened, providing a journey time of less than 4 hours between the two German cities."
677,Munich is an integral part of the motorway network of southern Germany.
678,"Motorways from Stuttgart (W), Nuremberg, Frankfurt and Berlin (N), Deggendorf and Passau (E), Salzburg and Innsbruck (SE), Garmisch Partenkirchen (S) and Lindau (SW) terminate at Munich, allowing direct access to the different parts of Germany, Austria and Italy."
679,"Traffic, however, is often very heavy in and around Munich."
680,Traffic jams are commonplace during rush hour as well as at the beginning and end of major holidays in Germany.
681,"There are few ""green waves"" or roundabouts, and the city's prosperity often causes an abundance of obstructive construction sites."
682,"Other contributing factors are the extraordinarily high rates of car ownership per capita (multiple times that of Berlin), the city's historically grown and largely preserved centralised urban structure, which leads to a very high concentration of traffic in specific areas, and sometimes poor planning (for example bad traffic light synchronisation and a less than ideal ring road)."
683,"Franz Josef Strauss International Airport (IATA: MUC, ICAO: EDDM) is the second-largest airport in Germany and seventh-largest in Europe after London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Madrid and Istanbul Atatürk."
684,"It is used by about 46 million passengers a year, and lies some 30 km (19 mi) north east of the city centre."
685,It replaced the smaller Munich-Riem airport in 1992.
686,The airport can be reached by suburban train lines from the city.
687,From the main railway station the journey takes 40–45 minutes.
688,An express train will be added that will cut down travel time to 20–25 minutes with limited stops on dedicated tracks.
689,"A magnetic levitation train (called Transrapid), which was to have run at speeds of up to 400 km/h (249 mph) from the central station to the airport in a travel time of 10 minutes, had been approved, but was cancelled in March 2008 because of cost escalation and after heavy protests."
690,Lufthansa opened its second hub at the airport when Terminal 2 was opened in 2003.
691,"In 2008, the Bavarian state government granted a licence to expand Oberpfaffenhofen Air Station located west of Munich, for commercial use."
692,"These plans were opposed by many residents in the Oberpfaffenhofen area as well as other branches of local Government, including the city of Munich, which took the case to court."
693,"However, in October 2009, the permit allowing up to 9725 business flights per year to depart from or land at Oberpfaffenhofen was confirmed by a regional judge."
694,"Despite being 110 km (68 mi) from Munich, Memmingen Airport has been advertised as Airport Munich West."
695,"After 2005, passenger traffic of nearby Augsburg Airport was relocated to Munich Airport, leaving the Augsburg region of Bavaria without an air passenger airport within close reach."
