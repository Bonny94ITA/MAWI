167,"Together with these towns (and some larger nearby towns, e.g., Hanau, Rodgau, Dreieich, Langen) Frankfurt forms a contiguous built-up urban area called Stadtregion Frankfurt which is not an official administrative district."

176,The overall tendency for higher temperatures can be seen when comparing the climate data from 1981 to 2010 with the data from 2010 to 2020.
177,"It is getting sunnier, drier and warmer and the climate resembles more a humid subtropical climate (Cfa)."
178,"Being an urban heat island, Frankfurt is sometimes affected by tropical nights, where the temperature does not drop under 20 °C between May and September."
179,This occurs because the density of the city causes it to store all the heat.
180,"The growing season is longer when compared to the rest of Germany, thus resulting in an early arrival of springtime in the region."
181,"Winters in Frankfurt are generally mild or at least not freezing with a small possibility of snow, especially in January and February but dark and often overcast."

184,"Some days with lows under −10 °C can occur more often here than at the coasts of Northern Germany, but not that frequently like in Bavaria or the eastern parts of Germany."
185,"Because of the mild climate in the region, there are some well-known wine regions not far away such as Rhenish Hesse, Rheingau, Franconia (wine region) and Bergstraße (route)."

192,"After the war, at the end of the year 1945, the number had dropped to 358,000."
193,"In the following years, the population grew again and reached an all-time-high of 691,257 in 1963."

196,"As of 2015, Frankfurt had 1909 ultra high-net-worth individuals, the sixth-highest number of any city."
197,"During the 1970s, the state government of Hesse wanted to expand the city's administrative boundaries to include the entire urban area."
198,This would have made Frankfurt officially the second-largest city in Germany after Berlin with up to 3 million inhabitants.
199,"However, because local authorities did not agree, the administrative territory is still much smaller than its actual urban area."
200,"According to data from the city register of residents, 51.2% of the population had a migration background as of 2015, which means that a person or at least one or both of their parents was born with foreign citizenship."
201,"For the first time, a majority of the city residents had an at least part non-German background."
202,"Moreover, three of four children in the city under the age of six had full or partial immigrant backgrounds, and 27.7% of residents had a foreign citizenship."
